### Links

- Live Site URL: [Click me](https://vinnie-tec.github.io/Space-Tourism-Page/crew-engineer.html)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Little vanilla JS

### What I learned
I learnt some basic styling properties in CSS, flexbox and grid for responsiveness. I learnt how to meddle with the display and position propertiy.

### Continued development

I planned on working more on responsive designs, exploring deep into JS and React.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://github.com/LoufaSupreme/scrimba_space-tourism/blob/main/index.css) - This helped me in some area I'm confused. I really liked the way he structured his CSS properties.
